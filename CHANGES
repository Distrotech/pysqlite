pysqlite Changelog
==================

Version 2.7.0
-------------

(released on August 12th 2015)

NEW FEATURES

- The limit functionality of SQLite is now wrapped.

BUILD PROCESS

- Instead of fts3, build fts5 extension when using amalgamation.
- use pkg-config for finding SQLite if available
- Removed the download/unpacking of SQLite amalgamation files. If you now want
  to statically build against the SQLite amalgamation files, download them
  yourself and put them in the pysqlite root directory.

  that we have all integer constants mapped to Python.
- Use Travis CI
- Added Trove classifier to make sure Python 3 users do not accidentally try to install it.

BUGFIXES 

- Fix for parsing fractional second part of timestamps.
- Fixed bug where when using converters, empty strings ended up as None on the Python side.
- SQLite can cope with text with embedded NUL. We can now, too.
